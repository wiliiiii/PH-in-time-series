# Time Series

This repository contains Python scripts for studying time series data using **persistent homology** and related tools.  
It includes implementations for Takens' embedding, persistence diagrams, and coefficient field dependence analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- **MainCodes.py**  
  Main pipeline for:
  - Generating time series datasets
  - Find optimal parameters(embedding dimension and time delay)
  - Performing Takens' embedding
  - Applying PCA for visualization
  - Computing persistence diagrams (using Giotto-TDA)

- **Quantities.py**  
  Utility functions to compute:
  - LÂ² and LÂ³ norms of barcodes
  - Maximum persistence
  - Other numerical invariants

- **VerifyCoeffDependence.py**  
  Script to verify the dependence/independence of persistence diagrams  
  on the choice of coefficient field.
